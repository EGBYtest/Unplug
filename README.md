# ScreenTimeLock

> **v1.1 (Beta)** — Take control of your digital habits.

Android screen time management app. Set daily time limits on app groups. Once exhausted, earn extra time by watching an ad or completing a typing challenge.

> **Privacy-first, open source.** All data stored locally. Nothing leaves your device.

---

## Features

### App Group Limits
- Group apps into categories (Social Media, Games, Entertainment...)
- Set daily time limit per group (30 min, 1 hour, or 0 = block immediately)
- Saved locally, reset daily

### Real-Time Enforcement
- **Accessibility Service** detects foreground app switches
- Exceed limit → non-dismissible lock screen popup
- Works in split-screen and PiP mode

### Bypass Mechanisms
| Method | Bonus Time | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Watch rewarded ad | +1 min (configurable) | Ad unit IDs in `ad_reward_system.dart` |
| Type 100-word challenge | +1 min | Copy-paste blocked; forces intentionality |

### Locked Settings
- Changing limits requires ad or typing challenge
- Toggle in Settings → SECURITY → Lock Settings
- Prevents impulse tweaks

### Privacy Dashboard
- Circular progress ring — total screen time vs. limit
- Per-group progress bars with color coding
  - 🟢 Green = safe
  - 🟡 Yellow = nearing limit
  - 🔴 Red = exhausted

### Usage Statistics
- **Groups** — number of configured app groups
- **Exhausted** — groups that hit limit today
- **Active** — groups still within limit

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Local-only storage** | SharedPreferences — no server, no network calls |
| **Kotlin Accessibility Service** | Real-time foreground app detection |
| **Dart-side usage stats** | `usage_stats` package for dashboard; native re-reads prefs for enforcement |
| **MethodChannel bridge** | `app_closure` channel for Flutter ↔ Android |
| **Cupertino widgets** | iOS-style dark theme, premium feel |
| **Typing challenge** | Forces mindful decision to bypass limits |
| **No re-check on foreground** | Permissions checked once during onboarding |

---

## Permissions

| Permission | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` | Read app usage for screen time tracking |
| `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` | Detect blocked app opens & enforce limits |

Both granted manually in system settings. On **OxygenOS/ColorOS**, navigate to:
Settings → Accessibility → Downloaded apps → ScreenTimeLock.
